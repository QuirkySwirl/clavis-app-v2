# **Joie de Vivre: A Transcontinental Odyssey from Chaos to Bliss**

Author: Kartik Iyer

## **Prologue: Parisian Reflections**

In mid-2020, as COVID-19 lockdowns eased, my evening strolls along Rue de la République in Puteaux became a cherished ritual. Just eight months earlier, I had arrived in Paris, spending most of that time in isolation. Clapping at 7 PM from my French balcony became my virtual socializing, a way to chase away the isolation blues.

Paris, the City of Love, creates an unforgettable scene. Picture a fine Parisian morning: sunrays flirting with the shimmering Seine, the aroma of fresh croissants wafting from quaint cafés, pigeons squawking around the Cathedral. This is Rue de la République in Puteaux. Can you feel the vibe?

My cultural shift felt like a riotous roller-coaster ride, or Alice tumbling down the rabbit hole. This journey from India's whirlwind streets to Paris's tranquil boulevards unveiled a new world filled with paradoxes, memories, and an unexpected self-discovery.

## **Chapter 1: Indian Landscapes – A Flavored Tale through Time**

Let's rewind to where it all began: India. A riotous carnival of diverse cultures, landscapes, and traditions, India remains my solid foundation amid the chaos. Our story starts in the color-splashed chaos of 1980s and early 1990s India, a time of transition and growth.

Imagine being a little knee-high tot amid a teeming ocean of humanity, struggling to tie your shoelaces while coping with the unspoken competition of life in bustling India. This era was like a well-spiced Biryani – a million flavors, colors, and aromas.

This was the golden age of Indian Television. Families gathered like moths around a newly discovered lamp, absorbing stories of our culture and history. Shows like 'Buniyaad' and 'Chitrahaar' brought families together, highlighting the binding factor of shared experiences.

In terms of Hofstede's cultural dimensions, India scores high on Power Distance and Collectivism. We're all about familial ties, societal norms, and respect for authority. Work hard, climb the ladder, even if most of the rungs seem out of reach \- that's our bread and butter.

Yet, this doesn't paint a picture of grim doggedness. It's more like a colorful, chaotic Bollywood dance number set to a lively Bhangra beat. Our Indian television stories united families, providing shared joy amid disguised lessons on life, hard work, and resilience.

## **Chapter 2: The Chrysalis Opens \- From a Cubicle to Cafe Conversations**

Fast forward to my adult years, climbing the corporate ladder from an entry-level job to managing teams, operations, and projects. Success tasted sweet, but I couldn't help craving something more – like yearning for spice in the middle of a three-course sweet buffet.

A move to Sydney, Australia in 2005 marked a significant milestone. Standing at the precipice of a new life, wrestling with the heavy Australian accent and their unconventional affinity for Vegemite, I discovered a culture that passionately embraced life after work hours and heavily invested in vibrant social interactions.

During carefree catch-ups, I recognized that life wasn't just about relentless work hours and overflowing emails. It was about shared laughter, the joy of a well-played soccer game, exploring foreign lands, and savoring the journey of life. Fifteen years elapsed, and this Sydney-induced realization transformed into a profound epiphany on the verdant streets of Rue de la République.

However, a question lingered: Why was there such a stark contrast between my Indian upbringing and these fresh Western perspectives? Why is there a persistent struggle to shift our focus from colossal achievements to simply experiencing life?

## **Chapter 3: The Paradigm Shift**

In 2020, I found myself stepping on the cobblestones of Paris, a city that seemed straight out of a Van Gogh masterpiece. Bidding adieu to the emphatic Bhangra beat, life decided to teach me the subtle art of the waltz.

Settling into Parisian life, I made friends with 'Joie de Vivre' – a French expression that can make even a robot feel warm and fuzzy. It wasn't about a sprint towards success, but about savoring the present. Enjoying a warm croissant over a chat, taking a leisurely coffee break – these tiny moments weren't dependent on wealth but on slowing down to enjoy the humdrum of life.

Suddenly, wealth was no longer the trophy but a tool, much like a well-worn paintbrush that adds color to the canvas of life.

Research tells us that French people value the "Work to live, not live to work" philosophy (Pot, Keizer, and Werff, 2013). They have a collective agreement to value their personal time, which naturally finds its way into their work-life balance, eventually turning money into a means and not the be-all and end-all of existence.

Chasing money and fame can often tug you away from what truly matters. I discovered this while navigating the serpentine streets of Paris and observing how our actions enrich lives. Bringing up children, creating art, investing time in hobbies, or upgrading your intellectual software – these activities turbocharge our existence beyond the dull routines\!

The biggest shift was understanding that wealth is not the paycheck, but the hours you own. It's about doling out time to work, yet keeping a large scoop for your personal growth and sparking joy. This spins our perspective around to see money as a means to richer life experiences rather than hoarding coins like a Scrooge.

## **Epilogue: Reflections on Wealth and Status**

After living in diverse cultures and witnessing different cultural dimensions firsthand, my journey kept coming back to one central metaphor — the 'Wheel of Life'. Comprising numerous spokes such as health, relationships, personal growth, career, hobbies, and finance, the wheel symbolizes how a rounded, balanced living creates a fulfilling existence.

Having re-imagined life as a carousel, everything from health, relationships, self-growth, cozying up with a book, to work, and the occasional splash of cash – all spin together in harmony. Driving this lively merry-go-round? Happiness\! Once you realize that happiness is not the pot at the end of the rainbow, but sparkles in everyday moments, you begin to relish the journey more than the destination.

Packed with profound learning from India to Sydney, and then to Paris, my life odyssey enriched my understanding of how we interpret wealth, fulfillment, and our pursuit of happiness. Each culture has its unique rhythm, its standard tempo, and its unique dance. Embrace your unique dance, and remember, the best rhythm to sway to is the rhythmic dance of life.

So, here's the question I'll leave you with \- Are you in a race for wealth and status, or are you dancing to the rhythm of life? The best dance \- the one that brings genuine joy \- lies in the simple act of living. It is not racing towards a financial finish line, but swaying and spinning in the music of life's everyday moments.

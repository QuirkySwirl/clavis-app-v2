  "importance_of_data_quality_summary": "Data plays an increasingly important useful role in society. Dependence on data for many activities and processes is increasing. Quality of data is therefore of growing importance and should be managed. Bad quality data puts an organisation at risk. It can lead to bad decisions, unsatisfied customers, unsatisfied data consumers, fines due to non-compliance, hidden costs (rework), bad reputation, unsatisfied employees, and lack of interoperability."
